### Hello, I'm Logan.
I'm a highschool senior planning on a computer science degree over the next four years.
<br>
<br>
The languages I'm most experienced with are JavaScript, Python, and Unity C#. I enjoy coding in general but my main passion is game development.
<br>
<br>
While not the most experienced, I really do love learning about code and technology in general and would be glad to collaborate or help with any opportunities.
