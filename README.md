### Hello, I'm Logan.
I'm a highschool senior planning on a computer science degree over the next four years.
<br>
I'm best at and enjoy working with JavaScript and Python, but I'm passionate about C# for game development in Unity. 
<br>
While not the most experienced, I really do love learning about code and technology in general and would be glad to collaborate or help with any opportunities.
